## Quickstart

Click this button to create a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) workspace with the project set up, Postgres started, and Fly pre-installed

[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)

## Development

It is important for you to have these things installed:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

- You have to clone the code by using this URL https://github.com/copods/kela-quiz.git
- Run this command to install all the packages

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

- Run the command to start the Docker

  ```sh
  npm run docker
  ```

  > **Note:** The npm script will complete while Docker sets up the container in the background. Ensure that Docker has finished and your container is running before proceeding.

- Create .env file from .env.example file and add data from this excel [File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QHtxVvBboDRcMuR0ZIql-xSZxiwj9oNqRItVR0fx0hA/edit#gid=0):

- To understand the content of the above file, you can read `SECRET.md` file

- Initial setup:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Run the first build:

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

This Remix Stack comes with two GitHub Actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

- [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

- Sign up and log in to Fly

  ```sh
  fly auth signup
  ```

  > **Note:** If you have more than one Fly account, ensure that you are signed into the same account in the Fly CLI as you are in the browser. In your terminal, run `fly auth whoami` and ensure the email matches the Fly account signed into the browser.

- Create two apps on Fly, one for staging and one for production:

  ```sh
  fly apps create blues-stack-template
  fly apps create blues-stack-template-staging
  ```

  > **Note:** Once you've successfully created an app, double-check the `fly.toml` file to ensure that the `app` key is the name of the production app you created. This Stack [automatically appends a unique suffix at init](https://github.com/remix-run/blues-stack/blob/4c2f1af416b539187beb8126dd16f6bc38f47639/remix.init/index.js#L29) which may not match the apps you created on Fly. You will likely see [404 errors in your Github Actions CI logs](https://community.fly.io/t/404-failure-with-deployment-with-remix-blues-stack/4526/3) if you have this mismatch.

- Initialize Git.

  ```sh
  git init
  ```

- Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new), and then add it as the remote for your project. **Do not push your app yet!**

  ```sh
  git remote add origin <ORIGIN_URL>
  ```

- Add a `FLY_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub repo. To do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`.

- Add a `SESSION_SECRET` to your fly app secrets, to do this you can run the following commands:

  ```sh
  fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app blues-stack-template
  fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app blues-stack-template-staging
  ```

  > **Note:** When creating the staging secret, you may get a warning from the Fly CLI that looks like this:
  >
  > ```
  > WARN app flag 'blues-stack-template-staging' does not match app name in config file 'blues-stack-template'
  > ```
  >
  > This simply means that the current directory contains a config that references the production app we created in the first step. Ignore this warning and proceed to create the secret.

  If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use [1password](https://1password.com/password-generator/) to generate a random secret, just replace `$(openssl rand -hex 32)` with the generated secret.

- Create a database for both your staging and production environments. Run the following:

  ```sh
  fly postgres create --name blues-stack-template-db
  fly postgres attach --app blues-stack-template blues-stack-template-db

  fly postgres create --name blues-stack-template-staging-db
  fly postgres attach --app blues-stack-template-staging blues-stack-template-staging-db
  ```

  > **Note:** You'll get the same warning for the same reason when attaching the staging database that you did in the `fly set secret` step above. No worries. Proceed!

Fly will take care of setting the `DATABASE_URL` secret for you.

Now that everything is set up you can commit and push your changes to your repo. Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment, and every commit to your `dev` branch will trigger a deployment to your staging environment.
If you run into any issues deploying to Fly, make sure you've followed all of the steps above and if you have, then post as many details about your deployment (including your app name) to [the Fly support community](https://community.fly.io). They're normally pretty responsive over there and hopefully can help resolve any of your deployment issues and questions.

### Multi-region deploys

Once you have your site and database running in a single region, you can add more regions by following [Fly's Scaling](https://fly.io/docs/reference/scaling/) and [Multi-region PostgreSQL](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/multi-region-databases/) docs.

Make certain to set a `PRIMARY_REGION` environment variable for your app. You can use `[env]` config in the `fly.toml` to set that to the region you want to use as the primary region for both your app and database.

#### Testing your app in other regions

Install the [ModHeader](https://modheader.com/) browser extension (or something similar) and use it to load your app with the header `fly-prefer-region` set to the region name you would like to test.

You can check the `x-fly-region` header on the response to know which region your request was handled by.

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc. Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## Seeding data on Staging/Prod

We have to seed data manually on the server.
Login to flyctl from your terminal using command

```sh
flyctl auth login
```

Then follow the command to proxy the db of server

```sh
flyctl proxy 5432 -a <postgres-app-name>
```

You will be getting ping from server. Now, from your project you can run seed command to run seed file to update seed data in remote database.

```sh
npx prisma db seed
```

## Creating A Branch from Github

For Creating a new branch, you can to go to the `Issues` section in Github and select the `Create a branch` from `development` section of that particular Issue.

> **NOTE** - You can check the branch source from `Change branch source`.

## Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase;
- Components Folder: kebab-case;
- Route File / Folder Names: kebab-case;
- Slug File Names: camelCase;
- Class Name: camelCase
- ID Atrributes: kebab-case

## Git Commit Syntax

- For committing the code use following syntax-

```sh
git commit -m '<type>() :<description>'
```

The commit `<type>` can include the following:

- feat – a new feature is introduced with the changes
- fix – a bug fix has occurred
- chore – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
- refactor – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- docs – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
- style – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
- test – including new or correcting previous tests
- perf – performance improvements
- ci – continuous integration related
- build – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- revert – reverts a previous commit

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc. Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## Prisma Database

We are using Prisma which is an open source database toolkit in our project.
You can learn the main concepts of [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts) from its official documentation.

- You can check all the models/schema from `schema.prisma` file
- If you are changing the database schema in `schema.prisma` file, you have to push the database to reflect those changes by running this command

  ```sh
  npm run db:push
  ```

  You can also reset the database yourself to undo manual changes or db push experiments by running the command:

  ```sh
  npm run prisma:reset
  ```

## Testing

We are using Cypress for our End-to-End tests in this project.
You can learn the [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/) from offical documentation.

You'll find those in the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `cypress/e2e` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

which will start the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client. Make sure the database is running in docker as described above.

Also you can run cypress for testing of components on browser by running following command

```sh
npm run cypress
```

We have a utility for testing authenticated features without having to go through the login flow:

```ts
cy.login()
// you are now logged in as a new user
```

We also have a utility to auto-delete the user at the end of your test. Just make sure to add this in each test file:

```ts
afterEach(() => {
  cy.cleanupUser()
})
```

That way, we can keep your local db clean and keep your tests isolated from one another.

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
